always initilize with readme. Why? 

git clone "URL"
	pulls a repository in using its URL that you get from github
git add
	adds a file to the thing
git status
	shows what's different between us and the cloud
git commit -m "added file to thing"
	commits change with a message
git push
	syncs things on my machine to github.com
git pull
	get of the changes
	
esc :wq is how you get out of changes.
